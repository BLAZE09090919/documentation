**Scrub Task**

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Pool | Choose a pool to scrub. |
| Threshold days | Days before a completed scrub is allowed to run again. This controls the task schedule. For example, scheduling a scrub to run daily and setting Threshold days to 7 means the scrub attempts to run daily. When the scrub is successful, it continues to check daily but does not run again until seven days have elapsed. Using a multiple of seven ensures the scrub always occurs on the same weekday. |
| Description | Describe the scrub task. |
| Schedule | How often to run the scrub task. Choose one of the presets or *Custom* to use the **Advanced Scheduler**. |
| Enabled | Unset to disable the scheduled scrub without deleting it. |
