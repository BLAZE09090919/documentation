**General Options**

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TCP Port | Open a port for SSH connection requests. |
| Log in as Root with Password | Root logins are discouraged. Allows root logins. A password must be set for the root user account. |
| Allow Password Authentication | Enabling allows using a password to authenticate the SSH login. Warning: when directory services are enabled, allowing password authentication can grant access to all users imported by the directory service.<br><br> Disabling changes authentication to require keys for all users. This requires additional setup on both the SSH client and server. |
| Allow Kerberos Authentication | Ensure valid entries exist in Directory Services > Kerberos Realms and Directory Services > Kerberos Keytabs and the system can communicate with the Kerberos Domain Controller before enabling this option. |
| Allow TCP Port Forwarding | Set to allow users to bypass firewall restrictions using the SSH port [forwarding feature](https://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ssh-port-forwarding). |
