TrueNAS SCALE has a simple permissions manager and a full Access Control List (ACL) editor for defining dataset permissions.
Permissions control the actions users can perform on dataset contents.

## ACL Types in SCALE

TrueNAS SCALE offers two types of ACLs: POSIX.1e, which is the SCALE default, and NSFv4, which uses the same editor as TrueNAS CORE.

Users can select what ACL type they'd like a new dataset to use while creating it. 
To change an existing dataset's ACL type, click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Options">more_vert</i> button next to the intended dataset and select *Edit Options*. Next, click *Advanced Options* and scroll down to the *ACL Type* drop-down. 

{{< hint warning >}}
**WARNING: Changing the ACL type affects how on-disk ZFS ACL is written and read.**

When the ACL type changes from POSIX to NFSv4, internal ZFS ACLs do not migrate by default, and access ACLs encoded in posix1e extended attributes convert to native ZFS ACLs. 

When the ACL type changes from NFSv4 to POSIX, native ZFS ACLs do not convert to posix1e extended attributes, but ZFS will use the native ACL for access checks.    

Users must manually set new ACLs recursively on the dataset after changing the ACL type to avoid unexpected permissions behavior.   

Setting new ACLs recursively is destructive, so we suggest creating a ZFS snapshot of the dataset before changing the ACL type or modifying permissions.

For a more in-depth explanation of ACLs and configurations in TrueNAS SCALE, see our [ACL Primer]({{< relref "ACLPrimer.md" >}}).

### Basic Permissions Editor

The **Permissions Editor** option allows basic adjustments to a dataset's ACL and is the same for POSIX.1e and NFSv4 ACL types.

![BasicPermissionsSCALE](/images/SCALE/BasicPermissionsSCALE.png "Basic Permissions Editor")

{{< tabs "Edit Permissions" >}}
{{< tab "Dataset Path" >}}
*Path* shows the full pathway to the dataset. The system sets the dataset path when creating the dataset and it cannot change.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Owner" >}}
The *Owner* section controls which TrueNAS *User* and *Group* has full control of this dataset.

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| User | Select the user to control the dataset. Users created manually or imported from a directory service appear in the drop-down menu. |
| Apply User | Confirms changes to *User*. To prevent errors, changes to the *User* are submitted only when this box is set. |
| Group | Select the group to control the dataset. Groups created manually or imported from a directory service appear in the drop-down menu. |
| Apply Group | Confirms changes to *Group*. To prevent errors, changes to the *Group* are submitted only when this box is set. |
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Access" >}}
The *Access* section lets users define the basic *Read*, *Write*, and *Execute* permissions for the *User*, *Group*, and *Other* accounts that might access this dataset.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Advanced" >}}
The *Advanced* section allows users to apply permissions recursively to all directories, files, and child datasets within the current dataset.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

To switch from the basic permissions editor to the advanced ACL editor, click *Use ACL Manager*. 

An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of account permissions associated with a dataset and applied to directories or files within that dataset.
TrueNAS uses ACLs to manage user interactions with shared datasets and creates them when users add a dataset to a pool.

## POSIX.1e ACL Manager

To change dataset permissions, go to **Storage** and click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Options">more_vert</i> button next to the intended dataset, then click *Edit Permissions*.

![AdvancedACLEditorSCALE](/images/SCALE/AdvancedACLEditorSCALE.png "Advanced Permissions Editor")

{{< tabs "Edit POSIX.1e ACL" >}}
{{< tab "File Information" >}}
| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Path | Shows the full pathway to the file. |
| User | User who controls the dataset. This user always has permissions to read or write the ACL and read or write attributes. Users created manually or imported from a directory service appear in the drop-down menu. |
| Apply User | Confirm changes to *User*. To prevent errors, changes to the *User* are submitted only when this box is set. |
| Group | The group which controls the dataset. This group has the same permissions as granted to the group@ Who. Groups created manually or imported from a directory service appear in the drop-down menu. |
| Apply Group | Confirm changes to *Group*. To prevent errors, changes to the *Group* are submitted only when this box is set. |

Any user accounts or groups imported from a directory service can be selected as the primary *User* or *Group*.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Access Control List (ACEs)" >}}
To add a new item to the ACL, define *Who* the Access Control Entry (ACE) applies to, and configure permissions for the ACE.

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Add | Adds a new ACE to the Access Control List. |
| Who | The object the ACE permissions apply to. |
| Permissions | The read/write/execute permissions the *Who* will have. |
| Default | Set to include the ACE on newly created directories and files within the dataset. |
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< expand "ACL Details from Shell" "v" >}}
To view an ACL information from the console, go to **System Settings > Shell** and enter command:

```shell
getfacl /mnt/path/to/dataset
```
{{< /expand >}}

## NFSv4 ACL Manager

Choose **Select a preset ACL** and choose a preset.
The preset options are *OPEN*, *RESTRICTED*, or *HOME*.

Choose **Create a custom ACL** to create a new list of customized permissions.

{{< tab "File Information" >}}
| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Path | Shows the full pathway to the file. |
| User | User who controls the dataset. This user always has permissions to read or write the ACL and read or write attributes. Users created manually or imported from a directory service appear in the drop-down menu. |
| Apply User | Confirm changes to *User*. To prevent errors, changes to the *User* are submitted only when this box is set. |
| Group | The group which controls the dataset. This group has the same permissions as granted to the group@ Who. Groups created manually or imported from a directory service appear in the drop-down menu. |
| Apply Group | Confirm changes to *Group*. To prevent errors, changes to the *Group* are submitted only when this box is set. |

Any user accounts or groups imported from a directory service can be selected as the primary *User* or *Group*.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Access Control List (ACEs)" >}}
To add a new item to the ACL, define *Who* the Access Control Entry (ACE) applies to, and configure permissions and inheritance flags for the ACE.

{{< expand "ACL Details from Shell" "v" >}}
To view an ACL information from the console, go to **System Settings > Shell** and enter command:

```shell
getfacl /mnt/path/to/dataset
```
{{< /expand >}}

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Add | Adds a new ACE to the Access Control List. |
| Who | Access Control Entry (ACE) user or group. Select a specific User or Group for this entry, owner@ to apply this entry to the user that owns the dataset, group@ to apply this entry to the group that owns the dataset, or everyone@ to apply this entry to all users and groups. See [nfs4_setfacl(1) NFSv4 ACL ENTRIES](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/nfs4-acl-tools/nfs4_setfacl.1.en.html). |
| ACL Type | How the Permissions are applied to the chosen Who. Choose Allow to grant the specified permissions and Deny to restrict the specified permissions. |
| Permissions Type | Choose the type of permissions. Basic shows general permissions. Advanced shows each specific type of permission for finer control. |
| Permissions | Select permissions to apply to the chosen Who. Choices change depending on the Permissions Type. |
| Flags Type | Select the set of ACE inheritance Flags to display. Basic shows nonspecific inheritance options. Advanced shows specific inheritance settings for finer control. |
| Flags | How this ACE is applied to newly created directories and files within the dataset. Basic flags enable or disable ACE inheritance. Advanced flags allow further control of how the ACE is applied to files and directories in the dataset. |

### NFSv4 Permissions and Flags

Permissions are divided between Basic and Advanced options. The basic options are commonly used groups of the advanced options.

Basic inheritance flags only enable or disable ACE inheritance. Advanced flags offer finer control for applying an ACE to new files or directories.
