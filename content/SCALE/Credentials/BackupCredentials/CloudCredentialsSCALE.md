{{< toc >}}

The *Cloud Credentials* window in the **Backup Credentials** screen allows users integrate TrueNAS with Cloud Storage providers. 

{{< expand "Is this secure?" "v" >}}
To maximize security, TrueNAS encrypts cloud credentials when saving them.
However, this means that to restore any cloud credentials from a TrueNAS configuration file, you must enable *Export Password Secret Seed* when generating that [configuration backup]({{< relref "GeneralSettings.md" >}}).
Remember to protect any downloaded TrueNAS configuration files.
{{< /expand >}}

We recommend users have another browser tab open and logged in to the Cloud Storage Provider account you intend to link with TrueNAS.
Some providers require additional information that is generated on the storage provider account page.
For example, saving an Amazon S3 credential on TrueNAS could require logging in to the S3 account and generating an access key pair on the *Security Credentials > Access Keys* page.

To begin setting up a Cloud Credential, navigate to **Credentials > Backup Credentials** and click the *Add* button in the *Cloud Credentials* window.
