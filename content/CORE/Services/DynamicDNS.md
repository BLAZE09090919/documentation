[Dynamic Domain Name Service (DDNS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136) is useful when TrueNAS is connected to an ISP that periodically changes the IP address of the system.
With dynamic DNS, the system can automatically associate its current IP address with a domain name and continue to provide access to TrueNAS even if the system IP address changes.

## Configuring Dynamic DNS

DDNS requires registration with a DDNS service such as [DynDNS](https://dyn.com/dns/) before configuring TrueNAS.
Have the DDNS service settings available or open in another browser tab when configuring TrueNAS.
Log in to the TrueNAS web interface and go to **Services > Dynamic DNS**.

The required values for these fields are provided by your DDNS solution.
Start the DDNS service after choosing your *Provider* options and saving the settings.
