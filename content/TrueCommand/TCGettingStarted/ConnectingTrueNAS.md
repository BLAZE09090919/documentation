## Connecting Systems to TrueCommand

To connect a system to TrueCommand, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Systems**.
This menu is organized into two tabs: **Systems** and **System Groups**.
The **Systems** and **System Groups** tabs contain all the options to connect and organize systems in TrueCommand.
All added systems are listed in the **Systems** tab with the current connection status.

### Adding a System Manually

To connect a new system, click **+ NEW SYSTEM**.

Enter the system IP address or DNS hostname, the nickname, and the password.
If a mistake is made, the form can be reset by clicking **RESET FORM**.

### Adjusting Systems

Systems that are misconfigured (e.g. if you entered an incorrect password) appear offline in both the TrueCommand **Dashboard** and **Systems** list.

You can edit a system from the Systems list and enter new connection details. To go back to the original contents of the fields, click **RESET FORM**.

To remove a system from TrueCommand monitoring, click **Delete**.

## Organizing Systems into Groups

Groups are collections of systems that are organized by TrueCommand administrators.
Grouping systems allows efficient management of system permissions and reporting.

Open the **System Groups** tab to view the list of created groups and the systems they contain.
Create a Group by clicking **Configure <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i>&nbsp; > Systems > + NEW GROUP**.
Enter a name for the new group and click **ADD SYSTEM** to add a system to the group.
When all the desired systems are added to the group, click **CREATE GROUP**.

Editing a group allows you to update the group name or change which systems are members of that group.

To delete a system group, click **Delete** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i>.
Confirm the deletion by clicking **YES**.

### Approve the Connection Request

When the True Command logo starts moving, check the TrueCommand Cloud email address for a verification message.
The email contains a link to the Portal to confirm the connection and activate the TrueNAS system.

Click on the **New System** alert, fill in the information from the TrueNAS system, and click **Add System**.

It can take 10 to 15 minutes for the TrueNAS instance to fully sync up with TrueCommand Cloud.
When all systems are connected to TrueCommand Cloud, refer to the [TrueCommand Administration articles]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/Administration/_index.md" >}}) for more instructions about setting up configuration backups, alerts, reports, and role-based access control.
